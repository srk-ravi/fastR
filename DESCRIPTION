Description: An advanced R package for automated subject classification that combines
    the theoretical rigor of Ranganathans PMEST framework (Personality, Matter, 
    Energy, Space, Time) with OCLC FAST 9 facets (Topics, Geographic Names, Personal Names,
    Corporate Names, Form/Genre, Time Periods, Titles, Events, Meeting Names) for 
    comprehensive, authority-controlled subject analysis. Supports multi-domain analysis 
    across management, chemistry, and other academic disciplines with confidence scoring,
    integration analysis, and professional export capabilities.
